# Local build

Setup local toolchain as specified in [ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/local-toolchain/setup).

Run following commands to build firmware for the central/left and right half of the keyboard (with ZMK Studio support enabled):

```bash
MDIR=<path to this repo>

# For the central/left half:
west build -d build/c_dux_left -b nice_nano_v2 -S studio-rpc-usb-uart -- -DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES="$MDIR" -DSHIELD=c_dux_left -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y
# For the right half:
west build -d build/c_dux_right -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES="$MDIR" -DSHIELD=c_dux_right
```

Firmware files will be located in `build/c_dux_left/zephyr/zmk.uf2` and `build/c_dux_right/zephyr/zmk.uf2`.
